# How to: Manage the Crosshair Cursor's Visibility in the Printed Chart

This example demonstrates how the Print and Export functionality relies upon the [ChartOptionsPrint.PrintCrosshair](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraCharts.Printing.ChartOptionsPrint.PrintCrosshair) property.

The Chart Control displays the Crosshair Cursor on mouse click.
When the check button is checked, the Crosshair Cursor that the Chart Control currently shows will be printed.
